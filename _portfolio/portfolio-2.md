ðŸŒŸ Recently, I had the opportunity to attend the CodeFest meetup organized by #Baot. The event featured a workshop on Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, which introduced me to this concept. These challenges tested my creativity, problem-solving skills, and knowledge of various technologies.
The CTF challenges covered a wide range of subjects, including cryptography, steganography, web exploitation, reverse engineering, and network analysis. Each challenge presented a unique puzzle to solve, pushing me to sharpen my scripting, debugging, network analysis, and vulnerability exploitation skills.
Participating in these challenges was a captivating experience that allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. Even if it is not my main interest area it was good to discover new technologies and to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity and the technologies involved.
